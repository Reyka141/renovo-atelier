    "description": "We are a workshop where every thing gets a second chance and a new breath. \nIt is important for us not just to hem or replace the zipper, but to make sure that the clothes are again pleasing, fit comfortably and look decent. \nWe care about details and truly love our work - from repairs to custom tailoring and embroidery. \nFor us, the value of a thing is measured by the stories that it will continue with you."

  "FAQAnswers": {
    "title1": "What are the turnaround times for repairs and tailoring?",
    "answer1": "The time depends on complexity: basic repairs (hemming, zipper replacement, minor restoration) usually take 1–3 days, more complex alterations or custom tailoring — from 5 to 14 days. We always agree deadlines in advance and strive to deliver earlier, never compromising on quality.",
    "title2": "Do you work with expensive and delicate materials?",
    "answer2": "Yes, we confidently work with leather, cashmere, silk, and items with decorative elements. For complex fabrics, we use gentle technologies and an individual approach to preserve the fabric structure and appearance.",
    "title3": "Can you tailor an item exactly to fit my body?",
    "answer3": "Absolutely, custom fitting is one of our strengths. We clarify your preferences, take precise measurements, and offer solutions that will be comfortable to wear and look neat according to the item’s cut.",
